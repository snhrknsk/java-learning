I am a cat.
I am a cat.
I have, as yet, no name.
Where was I born?
I have no idea.
I only remember crying in a dark, wet place.
That was where I first laid eyes on a human being.
It was the most dangerous type of human, too, as I later learned: a college student.
They say that college students sometimes catch, cook, and eat us cats.
